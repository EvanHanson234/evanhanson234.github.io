    <h3>Building an Operating System - Pandos</h3>
    <p>I have built an operating system in the C programming language called Pandos. 
      This project was a challenging and exciting experience that allowed me to dive 
      into the core of computer systems and learn how they work. I gained a deeper 
      understanding of how operating systems manage and allocate system resources, 
      and how they interact with the underlying hardware.</p>

    <h3>Reuniting Pets with Owners Application</h3>
    <p>I am currently working on building an application that will help reunite 
      lost pets with their owners. The application will have both frontend and 
      backend components and will take data from the Facebook API. The aim of this 
      project is to help reunite as many lost pets with their owners as possible, 
      making the process quicker and more efficient.</p>

    <h3>Designing a Secure Network</h3>
    <p>In this project, I was tasked with configuring a PaloAlto firewall and 
      designing a secure network for a fictional company. The goal of this 
      project was to protect the company's sensitive data and maintain the 
      confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the network. I gained 
      valuable experience in firewall configuration and network security, and 
      learned about different security protocols and how they can be implemented 
      to protect a network.</p>

      <h3>Code_Projects</h3>
      <p>This is my Code_Projects repository. Here you will find a curated collection of coding projects 
        that showcase my journey of practicing and learning programming. These projects span various 
        programming languages, including Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, C, and HTML/CSS.</p>

      <p>Each project in this repository represents a unique challenge and serves as a testament to my 
        growth as a programmer. From simple programs to more complex applications, I have strived to 
        explore different domains and push my boundaries.</p>
        
      <p>By engaging in these coding projects, I have honed my skills, deepened my understanding of 
        programming concepts, and expanded my problem-solving abilities. I have embraced the opportunity 
        to apply my knowledge and creativity to bring these projects to life.</p>
